    """
    Modify a line from `/etc/portage/make.conf` which defines `MAKEOPTS`, so it
    sets the `-j` option with the specified number of jobs.

    If any `-j` or `--jobs` options have already been set, they will all be
    replaced by the new `-j` option.

    If no `-j` or `--jobs` option exists, then a new `-j` option will be added.

    If the line provided does not seem to be a valid `MAKEOPTS` definition,
    then it will be ignored, and a new `MAKEOPTS` definition with only the `-j`
    option set will be returned.

    :param line: the original line containing a `MAKEOPTS` definition
    :param num_jobs: the desired number of jobs to be set
    :return: a new `MAKEOPTS` definition which sets the `-j` option and can be
